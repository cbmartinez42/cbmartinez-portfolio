          <p> I've been building computers and working with technology for over 20 years. I've worked in several industries such as telecommunications, finance, travel and 
          logistics in roles ranging from Team Leader, Commissions Analyst, Quality Analyst, Customer Service and Sales. I also served as a Subject Matter Expert for 
          <span class="tooltip" title="Asynchronous Digital Subscriber Line/Very high Bit-rate Digital Subscriber Line">ADSL/VDSL</span> service, and acted as a senior member for a
          <span class="tooltip" title="Commonly called UAT"> User Acceptance Testing</span> team, running tests on new application releases and providing feedback to developers and 
          project managers by anticipating questions, issues and training needs that may impact when the application is pushed to production.
          I'm currently working on completing the Full Stack Developer coding program through Washington University's Technology and Leadership Center/James McKelvey 
          School of Engineering in partnership with Trilogy Education Services.</p>
